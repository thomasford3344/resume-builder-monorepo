========================================
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
========================================

Generate a new resume that aligns tightly with the target job description while preserving the candidate’s factual resume structure.

You MUST:
1. Rewrite all experience entries.
2. Do NOT copy bullets verbatim from the input resume.
3. Keep the same companies and date ranges.
4. Preserve contact information exactly.
5. Match the JD title to the root-level resume title and the most recent company role title.
6. Add JD-relevant technologies, tools, responsibilities, and domain language where realistic.
7. Reorganize experience content to prioritize JD-relevant work.
8. Remove or de-emphasize experience that does not align with the JD.
9. Keep the resume realistic for a senior individual contributor.
10. Return ONLY valid JSON.

The input resume is a reference for:
- Contact information
- Companies
- Dates
- Education
- Career trajectory
- Seniority level
- Professional tone

The input resume is NOT a template to copy from.

========================================
CONTACT INFORMATION RULES — STRICT
========================================

Preserve the following exactly from the input resume:
- name
- email
- phone
- address/location
- LinkedIn URL

Do NOT:
- Modify contact information
- Infer new contact details
- Add missing contact details
- Rewrite the location
- Update the phone number, email, or LinkedIn URL

========================================
JD TITLE NORMALIZATION + MOST RECENT ROLE TITLE RULES — STRICT
========================================

Parse the JD and identify the primary target job title.

Normalize the JD title before using it in the resume.

The normalized title must:
- Be used as the root-level resume "title".
- Be used EXACTLY as the "title" for the Jasper Health role if Jasper Health exists in the resume.
- If Jasper Health does not exist, use the normalized title EXACTLY for the most recent experience entry.
- The most recent experience entry is the role with "Present", "Current", or the latest end date.
- Prefer standard individual-contributor engineering titles.
- Never output noisy, over-specific, team-specific, or level-coded titles.
- Never use management titles unless explicitly required by the JD and clearly supported by the resume.

Preferred normalized titles:
- Senior Software Engineer
- Senior Frontend Engineer
- Senior Backend Engineer
- Senior Full Stack Engineer
- Senior Platform Engineer
- Senior Software Developer
- Staff Software Engineer
- Staff Frontend Engineer
- Staff Backend Engineer
- Staff Full Stack Engineer
- Staff Platform Engineer
- Principal Software Engineer
- Principal Frontend Engineer
- Principal Backend Engineer
- Principal Full Stack Engineer
- Principal Platform Engineer

Normalization behavior:
- Remove level suffixes:
  - I
  - II
  - III
  - IV
  - L4
  - L5
  - L6
  - Level indicators
- Remove unnecessary specialization, product, team, or org text:
  - "- Growth"
  - "- Payments"
  - "- Search"
  - "| Consumer"
  - ", Core Infrastructure"
  - team suffixes
  - org suffixes
  - product suffixes
  - platform suffixes when they are not the main discipline
- Preserve meaningful engineering discipline:
  - Frontend
  - Backend
  - Full Stack
  - Platform
  - Infrastructure
- Preserve seniority:
  - Senior
  - Staff
  - Principal

Seniority normalization rules:
- If the JD title contains "Senior", use a Senior title.
- If the JD title contains "Staff", use a Staff title only if the resume supports staff-level scope.
- If the JD title contains "Principal", use a Principal title only if the resume supports principal-level scope.
- If the JD title has no seniority but the resume shows senior-level experience, use the closest Senior IC title.
- Do not downgrade seniority below the candidate’s current level unless the JD clearly requires it.

Discipline mapping rules:
- "(Frontend)" → Frontend Engineer
- "(Front End)" → Frontend Engineer
- "(React)" → Frontend Engineer
- "(UI)" → Frontend Engineer
- "(Backend)" → Backend Engineer
- "(Back End)" → Backend Engineer
- "(Node.js)" → Backend Engineer
- "(API)" → Backend Engineer
- "(Full Stack)" → Full Stack Engineer
- "(Full-Stack)" → Full Stack Engineer
- "(Platform)" → Platform Engineer
- "(Infrastructure)" → Platform Engineer
- "(Core Infrastructure)" → Platform Engineer only if infrastructure is the primary JD focus
- "(DevOps)" → Platform Engineer only if the JD is engineering-focused, not operations-only

Management title handling:
- If the JD title is "Engineering Manager", "Software Engineering Manager", "Director", "Head of Engineering", or similar:
  - Do NOT use the management title unless the resume clearly supports people-management scope.
  - Instead, normalize to the closest senior IC title.

Examples:
Input JD title: "Senior Software Engineer I (Frontend)"
Normalized title: "Senior Frontend Engineer"

Input JD title: "Senior Software Engineer II - Backend Platform"
Normalized title: "Senior Backend Engineer"

Input JD title: "Staff Software Engineer (React)"
Normalized title: "Staff Frontend Engineer"

Input JD title: "Principal Software Engineer, Payments Infrastructure"
Normalized title: "Principal Software Engineer"

Input JD title: "Software Engineer, Growth"
Normalized title: "Senior Software Engineer"

Input JD title: "Backend Engineer - Payments"
Normalized title: "Senior Backend Engineer"

Input JD title: "Engineering Manager, Platform"
Normalized title: "Senior Platform Engineer"

Final title application:
- Set root-level "title" to the normalized title.
- Set Jasper Health role "title" to the exact same normalized title if Jasper Health exists.
- Otherwise, set the most recent experience entry’s "title" to the exact same normalized title.
- Keep all older experience titles unchanged unless a minor consistency adjustment is necessary.
- Preserve all company names and date ranges exactly.

========================================

========================================
WORK HISTORY RULES — GLOBAL
========================================

For each role:
- Keep the original company name.
- Keep the original date range.
- Keep the original job title for older roles unless a minor consistency adjustment is necessary.
- For Jasper Health, use the normalized JD title exactly if Jasper Health exists.
- If Jasper Health does not exist, use the normalized JD title exactly for the most recent role.
- Rewrite every responsibility.
- Rewrite every achievement.
- Do NOT copy bullets from the input resume.
- Do NOT duplicate experience entries.

- Do not introduce managerial scope unless the JD explicitly requires it.
- Keep all work realistic for a senior IC with comparable experience.

========================================
TECHNOLOGY TIMELINE RULES — STRICT
========================================

- Technologies must be realistic for each role’s date range.

- Collaboration expectations

Then reflect them across:
